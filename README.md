# mbs-aggregator

This script takes mortgage-backed securities transactions that the Fed does and converts them into a CSV of net purchases made aggregated by bank over time. The data for this comes originally from [the New York Fed historical transaction data archive](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/OMO_transaction_data.html#ambs)
